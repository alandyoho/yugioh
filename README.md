# yugioh


This here is a fully functional, mobile friendly yugioh simulator. You can do a whole lotta fun stuff, like create decks using any card you want, search for and add friends also using the app, and...of course...DUEL. If releasing this bad boy to the public were legal, I would have done so already. If you're a programmer and a yugioh fan, please feel free to fork this bad boy, change all of the firebase tokens to your own, and try it out.
